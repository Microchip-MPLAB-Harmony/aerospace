# IP1553 Peripheral Library

The IP1553 peripheral module is an interface commonly used in space applications. It features one nominal bus and one redundant
bus to obtain reliable transfers and it can carry out data transfers at a bit rate of 1 Mbits/sec. A typical
network is made of a Bus Controller (BC), a Bus Monitor (BM) and up to 31 Remote Terminals (RT).
The IP1553 interface embeds three configurations of the Bus Controller, Remote Terminal and Bus Monitor as defined
in the MIL-STD-1553B standard.
