# FLEXRAMECC_FixCallbackRegister

```c
void FLEXRAMECC_FixCallbackRegister(FLEXRAMECC_CALLBACK callback, uintptr_t context)
```

**Summary**

 Sets the pointer to the function (and it's context) to be called when the given FLEXRAMECC's ECC Fixable Error interrupt events occur.

**Description**

 This function sets the pointer to a client function to be called "back" when the given FLEXRAMECC's interrupt events occur. It also passes a context value (usually a pointer to a context structure) that is passed into the function when it is called. The specified callback function will be called from the peripheral interrupt context.

**Preconditions**

 FLEXRAMECC_Initialize must have been called for the associated FLEXRAMECC instance.

**Parameters**

* *callback* - A pointer to a function with a calling signature defined by the FLEXRAMECC_CALLBACK data type. Setting this to NULL disables the callback feature.
* *contextHandle* - A value (usually a pointer) passed (unused) into the function identified by the callback parameter.

**Returns**

 None

**Example**

Refer to the description of the [FLEXRAMECC_CALLBACK](#flexramecc_callback) data type for example usage.
