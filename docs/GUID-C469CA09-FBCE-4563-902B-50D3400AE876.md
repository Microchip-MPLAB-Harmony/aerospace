# SPW_CallbackRegister

```c
void SPW_CallbackRegister(SPW_CALLBACK callback, uintptr_t contextHandle)
```

**Summary**

Sets the pointer to the function (and it's context) to be called when the given SPW's interrupt events occurs.

**Description**

This function sets the pointer to a client function to be called "back" when the given SPW's interrupt events occurs. It also passes a context value (usually a pointer to a context structure) that is passed into the function when it is called. The specified callback function will be called from the peripheral interrupt context

**Preconditions**

SPW_Initialize must have been called for the associated SPW instance

**Parameters**

* *callback* - A pointer to a function with a calling signature defined by the SPW_CALLBACK data type. Setting this to NULL disables the callback feature
* *contextHandle* - A value (usually a pointer) passed (unused) into the function identified by the callback parameter

**Returns**

None

**Remarks**

None
