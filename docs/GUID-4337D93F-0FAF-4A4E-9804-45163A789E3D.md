# IP1553_CallbackRegister

```c
void IP1553_CallbackRegister(IP1553_CALLBACK callback, uintptr_t context)
```

**Summary**

Sets the pointer to the function (and it's context) to be called when the given 1553's interrupt events occur.

**Description**

This function sets the pointer to a client function to be called "back" when the given 1553's interrupt events occur. It also passes a context value (usually a pointer to a context structure) that is passed into the function when it is called. The specified callback function will be called from the peripheral interrupt context.

**Preconditions**

IP1553_Initialize must have been called for the IP1553 instance

**Parameters**

* *callback* - A pointer to a function with a calling signature defined by the IP1553_CALLBACK data type. Setting this to NULL disables the callback feature.

* *context* - A value (usually a pointer) passed (unused) into the function identified by the callback parameter.

**Returns**

None
