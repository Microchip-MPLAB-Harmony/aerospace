# ICM_CallbackRegister

```c
void ICM_CallbackRegister(ICM_CALLBACK callback, uintptr_t context)
```

**Summary**

Sets the pointer to the function (and it's context) to be called when the given ICM's interrupt events occur.

**Description**

This function sets the pointer to a client function to be called "back" when the given ICM's interrupt events occur. It also passes a context value (usually a pointer to a context structure) that is passed into the function when it is called. The specified callback function will be called from the peripheral interrupt context.

**Preconditions**

ICM_Initialize must have been called for the associated ICM instance.

**Parameters**

* *callback* - A pointer to a function with a calling signature defined by the ICM_CALLBACK data type. Setting this to NULL disables the callback feature.
* *contextHandle* - A value (usually a pointer) passed (unused) into the function identified by the callback parameter.

**Returns**

None

**Example**

```c
    // Refer to the description of the ICM_CALLBACK data type for
    // example usage.
```
