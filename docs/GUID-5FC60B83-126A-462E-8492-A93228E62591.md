# IP1553_BuffersConfigSet

```c
void IP1553_BuffersConfigSet(uint16_t* txBuffers, uint16_t* rxBuffers)
```

**Summary**

Set the memory base address for emmission and reception buffers

**Preconditions**

IP1553_Initialize must have been called for the IP1553 instance

**Parameters**

* *txBuffers* - Pointer to application allocated emission buffer base address. Application must allocate buffer from non-cached contiguous memory and buffer size must be 16 bit * IP1553_BUFFERS_SIZE * IP1553_BUFFERS_NUM.
* *rxBuffers* - Pointer to application allocated reception buffer base address. Application must allocate buffer from non-cached contiguous memory and buffer size must be 16 bit * IP1553_BUFFERS_SIZE * IP1553_BUFFERS_NUM.

**Returns**

None
